    <p class="fonti1"> History & Nature   </p>
    <p class="fonti2">
        According to archeological evidence, Native Americans first arrived in the Glacier area some 10,000 years ago. 
        The earliest occupants with lineage to current tribes were the Flathead (Salish) and Kootenai, Shoshone, and Cheyenne. 
        The Blackfeet lived on the eastern slopes of what later became the park, as well as the Great Plains immediately to the east.
         The park region provided the Blackfeet shelter from the harsh winter winds of the plains, allowing them to supplement their
          traditional bison hunts with other game meat.
